/**** Nyuu options/config file ****/
// This file contains all the default options for Nyuu
// You can customize these options to avoid having to specify them on the command line, however it is recommended that you not edit this file
// It is strongly recommended that you create a config file and supply it to Nyuu via the `--config` option, see config-sample.json for an example
// If the .json config file isn't sufficient, you can copy this file elsewhere and still use the `--config` option to read it. Missing options there will sourced from this file
// WARNING: this file is not maintained for backwards compatibility; this means that you'll need to re-set all custom options every time Nyuu is upgraded!

	queueCache: null, // maximum number of cached posts in the post-check queue; if this number is exceeded, posts are dropped from cache if possible; if posts cannot be dropped from cache, this value acts like queueBuffer and will pause uploading when full. Caching is only useful if posts need to be re-posted due to a failure condition, in which case, uncached posts need to be re-generated off disk; default 5 or min(connections*8,100) if unseekable streams are used

comment: '', // subject pre-comment
comment2: '', // subject post-comment
groupFiles: false, // group "similar" files (based on filename) together into sub-collections, similar to how usenet indexers would do it; only affects the file counter in the subject line

// filenames will be transformed according to the following setting, which is a function that will have the file's path and name passed to it
// the default is to keep the filename component only, which essentially flattens all files into a single directory
// this is similar to how other clients handle folders
// you can also return false from this function to skip specific files
fileNameTransform: require('path').basename,
// another example: include path, seperated by dashes (e.g. "MyFolder - SubFolder - SomeFile.txt")
