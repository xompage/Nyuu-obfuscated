Nyuu
====

>   *A powerful beast hidden by a deceptively cute exterior*

Nyuu is a **command-line [binary usenet poster](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet#Binary_content>)**.

Nyuu is designed primarily to be fast/efficient, reliable and customizable,
exposing all the interesting bits and pieces. From what I’ve seen, Nyuu excels
more than any other usenet posting client in these aspects.

Nyuu runs on top of node.js (which *everyone* knows is [bad ass rock star
tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzkRVzciAZg)) with minimal dependencies.
It does require one compiled module,
[yencode](https://animetosho.org/app/node-yencode), for ultra fast yEnc and
CRC32 calculation.

Features
========

**All the standard stuff:** i.e. Nyuu doesn’t miss out on what you need

-   NNTP SSL support

-   yEnc encoding

-   NZB creation, with minification & compression

-   Sub-directory handling

**Fast & efficient:** Nyuu is amongst the fastest (if not [the
fastest](bench/info.md#benchmark-2)) usenet posters, designed to run on low
power, overloaded servers with \>= 1Gbps connections

-   Multiple uploading connections

-   Post checking is asynchronous (minimal impact on speed)

-   Fastest yEnc and CRC32 implementations

-   Buffered async I/O (minimise the effects of slow disks)

-   No temporary files, no disk writes (except for writing the NZB output)

-   No unnecessary disk reads - only performs a single, sequential read pass
    over files

    -   If a post needs to be resubmitted, due to a check failure, and it is not
        cached, it will need to be re-read off disk

    -   PAR2 generation (when integrated) will require an extra initial pass of
        just the first 16KB of each file, and may require multiple read passes
        if all recovery blocks cannot fit in memory

**Reliable:** Nyuu was designed for automation and its reliability requirements

-   Requests are all retryable

-   Able to recover from connection failures/dropouts

-   Timeouts and limits to deal with unexpected server hangs or faults

-   Can selectively skip/ignore some errors

-   Post checking (aka header checks), with multiple attempts and post retrying

-   Unusual or unexpected events are logged

-   Includes some optional workarounds for server bugs

**Highly configurable:** tuning knobs for everything

-   Lots of connection and SSL options

-   NNTP article posting: article/line sizes, header customisation

-   Configure timeouts, delays and error handling parameters

-   NZB meta tags

**Unique features:** the not so usual stuff

-   Pipe input/output from/to processes instead of files, plus the ability to
    pipe out a copy of read input to an external process without incurring
    additional disk reads

-   Extensive upload diagnostic details available (via optional TCP/HTTP status
    server) to help tune settings or find problems

Installation & Requirements
===========================

Pre-Built Binaries
------------------

Static pre-built binaries with Node 4.x may be found on [the releases
page](https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu/releases) if I can be bothered to
provide them. These can simply be extracted and run.

### Arch

Archlinux users can install the latest binary-release by installing `nyuu-bin` from the AUR.

*Please note that [this Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nyuu-bin/) is maintained by a third party and not officially supported. If you have an issue please contact the maintainer.*

Install Via NPM
---------------

If NPM is installed (usually comes bundled with
[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)), the following command can be used
to install Nyuu:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
npm install -g nyuu --production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You’ll then be able to run Nyuu via the **nyuu** command.

If the **npm** command isn’t available, it can probably be installed via your
package manager (`apt-get install npm` for Debian), or see the following section
titled “Node.js” for more details.

If you get a `gyp ERR! stack Error: EACCES: permission denied` error when installing, try the following command instead:

```
npm install -g nyuu --production --unsafe-perm
```

Note: on some systems, you won’t get an error during installation, but when running Nyuu, it crashes with the error `Error: Cannot find module './build/Release/yencode.node'`. If that is the case, you may need to run the above command to get it to install properly.

You can then later uninstall Nyuu via:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
npm uninstall -g nyuu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install From Source
-------------------

Note that code from Git is considered to be unstable (or rather, less stable
than release versions). Stable packages can be found on [the releases
page](https://github.com/animetosho/Nyuu/releases).

### Node.js

Nyuu should run on node.js 0.10.x and later. Recent Linux distributions should
have *nodejs* in their repositories, otherwise, see [installing via package
manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) or
[NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions). For Windows/OSX
builds, they [can be found here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/stable/).
Although node.js 0.10.x is supported, newer versions of Node (\>=4 recommended)
provide greatly improved SSL performance.

### Dependencies

If you have NPM installed (may come with your install of NodeJS, or you may need
to install it like you did with NodeJS if your package system doesn’t include
them together), the following command (executed inside the Nyuu directory) is
all you need to set up the dependencies:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
npm install --production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don’t want to use NPM, you can use your package manager instead if it has
all the necessary packages - on Debian 8 / Ubuntu 14.04:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
apt-get install node-async
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, you can grab the dependencies manually: create a directory named
*node_modules* in the Nyuu directory. Inside of which, place
[async](https://github.com/caolan/async/releases).

For yencode, you’ll need to place it in the *node_modules* directory as well,
then follow [the installation
instructions](https://animetosho.org/app/node-yencode).

At the end, the folder structure should resemble something like (not all files
shown):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nyuu/
- bin/
- lib/
- node_modules/
  - async/
    - package.json
  - yencode/
    - index.js
package.json
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### “no suitable image found” error on MacOS 10.15

Due to security changes in OSX 10.15, libraries may require code signing to work. To deal with this, you’ll either need to [disable this security option](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_disable-library-validation?language=objc) or [codesign the built yencode module](https://successfulsoftware.net/2018/11/16/how-to-notarize-your-software-on-macos/). Note that I do not have OSX and can’t provide much support for the platform.

### Executable

Once dependencies have been installed, Nyuu can be run via `node bin/nyuu` or
`nodejs bin/nyuu`. If you wish to just use `nyuu` instead, you need to link to
it from somewhere your *PATH* environment points to. For example, on Linux you
might do

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ln -s "`pwd`/bin/nyuu.js" /usr/bin/nyuu
chmod a+x bin/nyuu.js
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(if Node is running via *nodejs* instead of *node*, you can edit the first line
in *bin/nyuu.js* to fix this)

For Windows, you can make a file named *nyuu.cmd* and place it in your system
directory, with the following contents:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@"C:\node\node.exe" "C:\path\to\nyuu\bin\nyuu.js" %*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(obviously, fix the paths to what they actually are)

Development
===========

Running Tests
-------------

Tests are run via *mocha*, installable via `npm install -g mocha`, and can be
run simply by using the `mocha` command inside Nyuu’s root directory.  
Note that some test cases test functionality of timeouts; to reduce time it
takes to run these tests, timeouts are set relatively small, which means that a
slow computer may not be able to service them as expected.

Building Binary
---------------

A basic script to compile the Nyuu binary is provided in the *nexe* folder. The script has been tested with NodeJS 12.20.0 and may work on other 12.x.x versions. For NodeJS 8.x.x and older, see section below.

1. If you haven’t done so already, do an `npm install` in Nyuu’s folder to ensure its dependencies are available
2. Enter the *nexe* folder and do an `npm install` to pull down required build packages (note, nexe requires NodeJS 10 or greater)
3. If desired, edit the variables at the top of *nexe/build.js*
4. Run `node build`. If everything worked, there’ll eventually be a *nyuu* or *nyuu.exe* binary built.
   If it fails during compilation, enter the *nexe/build/12.20.0* (or whatever version of NodeJS you’re using) and get more info by:
   * Linux: build using the `make` command
   * Windows: build using `vcbuild.bat` followed by build options, e.g. `vcbuild nosign x86 noetw intl-none release static no-cctest without-intl ltcg`
5. If building for Linux, optionally `strip` the executable to reduce size

### Building for NodeJS 8.x.x or older

Compiling Nyuu into a single binary can be done via
[nexe](https://github.com/nexe/nexe) 1.x. There is a little complication with
bundling the *yencode* module, but a rather fragile script has been supplied in
*nexe1/build.js* to help with the process. The following general steps need to be
taken:

1.  Ensure that *nexe* is installed (doesn’t need to be globally installed) and
    [its requirements](https://github.com/nexe/nexe#building-requirements) met
2.  Download a Node.js source package. The script has mostly been tested with
    Node 4.x.x, it may work with other versions
3.  The required Nyuu libraries need to be installed into the *node_modules*
    folder
4.  Inside the *nexe1* folder (the one containing *build.js*), create the
    following two folders: *node* and *yencode-src*
5.  Inside the *node* folder, create a folder with the version number of the
    package you downloaded in step 2, for example “4.9.1”. Inside *this* folder,
    create one named “\_” and place the downloaded sources in this folder. After
    doing this, the file *nexe1/node/x.x.x/\_/node.gyp* should exist, where
    *x.x.x* is the node version number
6.  Inside the *yencode-src* folder, copy the source code for the *yencode* (v1.0.x)
    module
7.  Edit *nexe1/build.js*; options that are likely to be edited are at the top of
    the file. You’ll likely need to change *nodeVer* to be the version of node
    you’re using
8.  You may need to edit *bin/nyuu.js* to fix the location of nexe’s *package.json* path (search *bin/nyuu.js* for `nexe/package.json` and update if necessary)
9.  In the *nexe1* folder, run *build.js*. This script patches node to embed the
    yencode module, and customises a few compiler options, then calls nexe to
    build the final executable. If it worked, you should get a binary named
    *nyuu* or *nyuu.exe* in the *nexe1* folder

Note that this will be built with the `-flto` option on non-Windows platforms.
If this causes build failures, your system’s `ar` utility may not support LTO
objects, which can be worked around if you have `gcc-ar` installed by issuing a
command like `export AR=gcc-ar`

Usage
=====

For command line usage, [see here](help.txt), [or here](help-short.txt) for a
summarized list of options.

Default Configuration
---------------------

As entering long command lines may be tiresome, you may use a config file with
Nyuu via the `--config` or `-C` option. You may use the *config-sample.json*
file as reference to what a config file should be like.

If a config file isn't specified, Nyuu will also search the `NYUU_CONFIG`
environment variable for a default configuration (saving you from needing to
specify this file on every run, if you set the environment up in your shell).

Planned Features
================

-   Integrate [ParPar](https://animetosho.org/app/parpar) for streaming PAR2
    creation

-   Streaming 7-Zip creation

-   Improve multi-server support for both posting and checking

-   Repost missing articles from NZB, and/or some sort of resumption support

-   SOCKS proxy support

-   A web (HTTP) interface would be nice as an alternative to the command line
    interface; not sure if it will be done however

Not planned
-----------

-   RAR support, since 7-Zip should cover everything
